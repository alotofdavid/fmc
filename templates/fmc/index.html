        <p>The Weekly FMC was made for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.speedsolving.com">the SpeedSolving.com web forums</a> so that fewest moves enthusiasts can regularly compete with others and share solutions to the same scramble in order to learn from each other. Click the scramble to submit a solution!</p>
        <p>Although it is not required to submit a solution, <a href="{% url 'register' %}">creating an account</a> will let the Weekly FMC record your results into a profile and provide you with statistics. The <a href="{% url 'leaders' %}">leaders board</a> lists all time shortest solutions along with the users with the lowest average move count and highest total score.</p>
        <p>
        So what are you waiting for? <a href="{% url 'detail' scramble.id %}">Submit a solution</a> to this week's scramble.

        <h3>How do I learn more about FMC?</h3>
        <p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/FMC">SpeedSolving Wiki</a> has a good description and collection of links about FMC. I recommend checking out Sebastiano Tronto's extremely comprehensive <a target="_blank" href="http://fmcsolves.cubing.net/fmc_tutorial_ENG.pdf">FMC Tutorial</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.speedsolving.com/forum/showthread.php?1566">this post</a> by Arnaud van Galen. Finally, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.speedsolving.com/forum/showthread.php?13599-The-FMC-thread">FMC thread</a> is the best place to go to share FMC attempts and get advice on techniques. Just make sure to search for an answer to your question before posting because it probably has been answered before.
